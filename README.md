# Rust & WebAssembly dev environment

This repo contains a dev container configuration to try out Rust & WebAssembly
development without installing all the tools necessary to compile Rust to WASM.

Open this workspace in VS Code and run the "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
task.

This repo also contains a bootstrapped wasm-pack project.
